# Global Author Posts Feed

**INACTIVE NOTICE: This plugin is unsupported by WPMUDEV, we've published it here for those technical types who might want to fork and maintain it for their needs.**

## Global Author Posts Feed grabs all the posts from a single author, from across an entire Multisite or BuddyPress network, and puts them in a single feed.

A feed just for a selected author that combines all their posts into one big RSS job.

### Completely Automated Setup

It's really straightforward. No pesky options to worry about. Once it's installed, simply click the Feed link next to the user's name under Users > All Users in your network admin to open that user's feed in a new window.

### How Will You Use It?

Here's some examples:

*   Use a theme that pulls RSS feeds onto it's homepage
*   Add it to a 3rd Party RSS feed widget in the side bar
*   Let readers subscribe to it using a feed reader

### To Get Started:

 Once the Global Author Posts Feed plugin is installed and activated, your new feed will be created at: http://yourdomain.tld/feed/globalauthorpostsfeed?author=USERID

### To Use

A new link is now added to the row of actions for each user under Users > All Users in your network admin. Simply click the link to open that user's feed in a new window. The feed URL for each user is located at:

http://yourdomain.tld/feed/globalauthorpostsfeed?author=USERID

 The user feed URL can be added to a site in numerous ways including:

*   A theme which pulls RSS feed onto it's homepage,
*   3rd Party RSS feed widgets in the site side bar
*   Readers can subscribe to it using feed readers such as Feedly
